model1: shufflenet v2 x1. No validation data.
model2: more data. Lax data collection procedures.
model3: 0.5, randomaffine, l2 reg, unfreeze stage3 layer with reduced LR, more data with better collection procedures.
model4: more data to represent classes. Added some more middle-game data as well.
model5: switched back to x1.0. Fewer epochs, no additional unfreezing, lower learning rate during training to reduce overfitting, but encouraged a bit of overfitting.
